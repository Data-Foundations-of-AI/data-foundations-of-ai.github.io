    <h2 class="section-title">Our Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Modern AI systems are shaped as much by their <strong>data</strong> as by their architectures and training algorithms.
      While data has traditionally been treated as a secondary artifact in AI research, its central role in determining model behavior, capabilities, and failure modes has become increasingly clear.
      Our goal is to foster an active research community focused on data as a first-class foundation of AI, systematically understanding, optimizing, and governing the data for better fueling AI development.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Scope</h2>
    <p>
      We focus on: (i) scientific understanding of training data, (ii) data-centric algorithms for improving training data,
      (iii) data and society (economy, governance, etc), and (iv) science of benchmarks and evaluation.
